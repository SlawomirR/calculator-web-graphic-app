# Calculator - web graphic app.
In progress ... early version. The idea of the application is to emulate basic look of calculator. It is design as REST Api. To demonstrate the usage Thymeleaf engine is used to genetate web page. 

Future idea:\
Content on the display part should be updated dynamically when buttons are pressed. On the beginning http will be fine but at the end it should communicate through websocket just for practice purposes.
